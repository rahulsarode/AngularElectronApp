Electron.js is a popular platform for building cross-platform desktop apps for Windows, Linux and macOS with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It’s created and maintained by GitHub and it’s available under the MIT permissive license.
Electron makes use of powerful platforms like Google Chromium and Node.js, but also provides its own set of rich APIs for interacting with the underlying operating system. Electron provides a native container that wraps web apps so they look and feel like desktop apps with access to operating system features.
